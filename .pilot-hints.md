# LangChain Project
Project LangChain is a framework for building context-aware reasoning applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It solves the problem of creating robust, stateful, and context-aware applications for developers by providing tools and libraries that facilitate development, debugging, testing, and monitoring.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project.
- **LangChain**: The core framework for building context-aware reasoning applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
- **LangGraph**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs.
- **LangSmith**: A developer platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring chains built on any LLM framework.
- **Sphinx**: Used for documentation generation.
- **Ruff**: A linter for maintaining code quality.
- **Codespell**: A tool for checking and correcting spelling errors in source code.

## Project Structure
- **Root Directory**: Contains configuration files like `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `pyproject.toml`.
- **.devcontainer**: Likely contains configuration for development containers.
- **.github**: Contains GitHub-specific configurations, such as workflows and issue templates.
- **cookbook**: Presumably contains example projects or tutorials.
- **docker**: Likely contains Docker-related files for containerization.
- **docs**: Contains documentation files.
- **libs**: Contains the core libraries and modules of the project, including `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, `langchain`, `langchain-experimental`, and `langchain-openai`.
- **scripts**: Likely contains utility scripts for various tasks.
- **templates**: Presumably contains template files for different purposes.

## Build and Run
To build and run the project, follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file. This typically involves setting up a Python environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and running the application or tests as specified.

## Deployment
Deployment details are not explicitly mentioned in the gathered information. However, given the presence of Docker-related files, containerization using Docker is likely a part of the deployment process.

## Testing
Testing details are not explicitly mentioned in the gathered information. However, the presence of linters like Ruff and tools like Codespell suggests a focus on maintaining code quality.

## Domain Model
The project is designed for building context-aware reasoning applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It leverages frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith to facilitate the development, debugging, testing, and monitoring of these applications.
